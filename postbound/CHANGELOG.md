# Changelog

Changelog will start once the high-level refactoring of PostBOUND is completed. Notice however, that PostBOUND should
still be considered to be in beta state. Therefore, a number of interfaces will still be changed frequently and changes
will often be breaking changes by definition. If you use PostBOUND in your research, make sure to update carefully.
