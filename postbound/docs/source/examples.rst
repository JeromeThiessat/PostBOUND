Optimization scenarios and examples
===================================

This part of the documentation is still work in progress. It will describe some examples of how some common optimization
scenarios can be implemented using PostBOUND. For now, please take a look at the API documentation of the ``postbound`` and
``stages`` modules.

Planned contents:

- native query plans
- benchmarking with `experiments.runner`
- Optimization algorithms:
  - random join order
  - cardinality injection
  - pessimistic optimization
- machine learning

The ``experiments`` directory also contains some ready to run scripts that can serve as first examples (although they are not
particularly well documented).
