Setup
=====

This part of the documentation is still work in progress. In the future, it will describe the setup process to get PostBOUND
experiments up and running in more detail. For now, please refer to the central README which should cover the basics.

Planned contents:

- database setup
- python setup, min version
- venv setup + requirements installation
- building as local pip package
- building the documentation? (that's a chicken-and-egg problem)
