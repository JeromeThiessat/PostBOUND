# Workloads

This directory provides different commonly used workloads to benchmark query optimizers. Each directory contains a
different workload. Notice, that since the Stack benchmark contains more than 5000 (static) queries, these are not
all kept in version control. Instead, the `setup.sh` script in the `Stack-Queries` directory can be used to inflate
all the queries.
